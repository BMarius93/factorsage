# Database Architecture

V2 has one Prisma schema and one migration history under `packages/database/prisma`.

API and worker may both depend on `@intrinsic/database`, but they do not share an in-memory PrismaClient. Each OS/container process owns its own client and pool.

Do not put Prisma in `apps/web`.

Initial engine: PostgreSQL. Do not change database engine as part of unrelated rewrite work.

## Current product model

Migration `20260822183050_add_user_auth` adds the first product table: the minimal `User` identity
model and `UserRole` enum (`USER`, `ADMIN`). PostgreSQL owns the unique email constraint. Email is
normalized by application write/lookup paths, and `passwordHash` is nullable for future external
identity compatibility.

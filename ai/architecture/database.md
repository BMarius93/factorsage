# Database Architecture

V2 has one Prisma schema and one migration history under `packages/database/prisma`.

API and worker may both depend on `@intrinsic/database`, but they do not share an in-memory PrismaClient. Each OS/container process owns its own client and pool.

Do not put Prisma in `apps/web`.

Initial engine: PostgreSQL. Do not change database engine as part of unrelated rewrite work.

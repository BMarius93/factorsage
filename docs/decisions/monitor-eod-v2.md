# Monitor EOD V2 — implementation record

## Status

**Accepted, implemented incrementally** by the Monitor EOD V2 pull-request stack. This document
records what each step actually built; `docs/decisions/monitor-eod-v2-proposal.md` is the proposal
and audit request it answers, and `docs/decisions/eod-finality-v1.md` is the finality rule every
step relies on. Sections are added as the steps land; a section describes merged-or-proposed code,
never intent.

| Step | Pull request | What it adds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `feat/eod-finality` | Finalized EOD bars everywhere (`eod-finality-v1.md`) |
| 2 | `feat/stock-eod-worker` | The `stock-eod` child and the ongoing-membership predicate (§1, §2) |

## 1. The Monitor universe: ongoing membership only

`isOngoingListMember(configuration, date)` and `ongoingMembershipStart(configuration)` in
`@intrinsic/domain` (`stock-lists.ts`) answer the V2 universe question, which is deliberately not
the backtest's:

| Membership | Ongoing on `date`? |
| --- | --- |
| `FULL` ("Always eligible") | yes, every date |
| `CUSTOM` with an open-ended period (`endDate: null`, "Present") that began on or before `date` | yes |
| `CUSTOM` with an open-ended period starting after `date` | not yet |
| `CUSTOM` with bounded periods only — even an end in the future | never |
| a multi-period member inside an earlier, closed period | no: only the open-ended period counts |

`Present` is an open-ended meaning, not a comparison with today: a bounded period ending in 2030 is
not a current membership. Earlier closed periods stay in storage and play no part. Backtests keep
`isBuyWindowEligible` — every period a member ever had, BUY only — unchanged; nothing in a backtest
calls the new predicate.

Step 2 uses it to decide which securities are prepared. Applying it to evaluation (BUY, SELL and
FINAL EXIT alike) and to the administrative closure of a membership edited away is step 4.

## 2. Stock EOD preparation: the `stock-eod` child

Provider work moves out of Monitor evaluation into a fourth supervised child of the one
`dev:worker` service (`apps/worker/src/stock-eod/`). It is a new **process kind**, not a new
service, container or server: one more entry in the supervisor's child list, its own
`STOCK_EOD_WORKER_PROCESSES` (default 1, at most 2; `0` disables it).

**Claim.** The fourth instance of the PostgreSQL claim idiom: row `STOCK_EOD` of
`MarketDataRefreshSchedule`, beside the ETF refresh's `ETF_MARKET_DATA`, claimed with
`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, a renewable lease, `claimedBy`-guarded writes and doubling backoff. The
schedule repository is scoped to one row id, so the two claims never contend; the claim loop is the
market-data loop, generic over its run and logging under `stock-eod.refresh.*`. No migration.

**Run.** Per pass:

1. Resolve the newest finalized NYSE session once (`EodFinalityPolicy.expectedSession`), so every
   security of the run is held to the same session; a schedule that cannot be read falls back to
   weekdays and says so (`stock-eod.calendar-unavailable`).
2. Read the running Monitors (`listActiveMonitors`: enabled, execution-eligible customer Monitors and
   globally enabled built-ins) and build the deduplicated union of their **ongoing** members on that
   session, each carrying the union of operands any watching Monitor reads (`stockEodUniverse`).
3. Per security, at `STOCK_EOD_SECURITY_CONCURRENCY` (2), PostgreSQL first: `stockRefreshState` and
   the finality decision. A security holding the session as read after it became final, with its
   history loaded from the product horizon, costs one PostgreSQL read and only the freshness checks of
   the operand inputs it needs (`prepareStockOperands`). Otherwise it enters `refreshStockTail`: coverage
   gaps, one bounded tail read, and statements only when some watching Monitor reads a
   statement-derived operand (`operandsReadStatements`).

History is loaded from the product horizon (clamped to the listing) on a security's first
preparation, once, so the Monitor evaluation's reconstructions and replays read PostgreSQL alone and
never need the provider.

**Outcomes.** `READY`, `AWAITING_PUBLICATION`, `NOT_PUBLISHED` (past the give-up bound), `FROZEN`,
`FAILED`, `DEFERRED` (budget or lease) and `BACKING_OFF`. A security failing while others succeed is
backed off in memory, doubling from the retry spacing to six hours; the run fails — and the claim
backs off — only when every attempt failed. A run that exhausts `STOCK_EOD_RUN_BUDGET_MS` asks to be
resumed after `STOCK_EOD_FOLLOW_UP_MS` rather than a full `STOCK_EOD_REFRESH_INTERVAL_MS`. Every run
logs `stock-eod.run.summary` with the session, universe size, provider requests and outcome counts.

**Cost.** A security already final costs no provider request and no Redis work — readiness is
PostgreSQL's answer, and an evicted stock is not re-materialized for it. A security that needs the
session costs one tail read plus, when the read adds a row, one earliest-rows confirmation
(`historical-price-basis-v1.md` §7), plus six statement requests when a statement-derived operand is
read and the statements are older than `STOCK_FUNDAMENTALS_FRESHNESS_MS`. The first preparation of a
never-seen security is its full hydration.

`pnpm stock-eod:refresh-once` runs one pass through the same claim and prints each security's
outcome. The QA matrix pool disables the child (its provider traffic is not a run's); the hermetic
E2E stack runs it over its frozen fixtures.
